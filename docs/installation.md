<h1>Installing ContainerSSH</h1>

ContainerSSH is provided on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/janoszen/containerssh/releases). The
easiest way to install it is to run it in a container itself from the
[Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/janoszen/containerssh). Depending on which backend you choose you may
have to provide additional options. For a simple Docker example check out [the quick start guide](quickstart.md)
